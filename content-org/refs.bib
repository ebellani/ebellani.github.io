                  and objectives of database systems and will become

                  personality, leadership, and organizational
                  effectiveness to make 3 major points. First,
                  leadership is a real and vastly consequential
                  phenomenon, perhaps the single most important issue in
                  the human sciences. Second, leadership is about the
                  performance of teams, groups, and organizations. Good
                  leadership promotes effective team and group
                  performance, which in turn enhances the well-being of
                  the incumbents; bad leadership degrades the quality of
                  life for everyone associated with it. Third,
                  personality predicts leadership—who we are is how we
                  lead—and this information can be used to select future
                  leaders or improve the performance of current
                  incumbents. }

  abstract =     {When writing a distributed application, conventional
                  wisdom says to split your application into separate
                  services that can be rolled out independently. This
                  approach is well-intentioned, but a
                  microservices-based architecture like this often
                  backfires, introducing challenges that counteract the
                  benefits the architecture tries to
                  achieve. Fundamentally, this is because microservices
                  conflate logical boundaries (how code is written) with
                  physical boundaries (how code is deployed). In this
                  paper, we propose a different programming methodology
                  that decouples the two in order to solve these
                  challenges. With our approach, developers write their
                  applications as logical monoliths, offload the
                  decisions of how to distribute and run applications to
                  an automated runtime, and deploy applications
                  atomically. Our prototype implementation reduces
                  application latency by up to 15\texttimes{} and
                  reduces cost by up to 9\texttimes{} compared to the
                  status quo.},

                  service which supplies such information is not a
                  satisfactory solution. Activities of users at
                  terminals and most application programs should remain
                  unaffected when the internal representation of data is
                  changed and even when some aspects of the external
                  representation are changed. Changes in data
                  representation will often be needed as a result of
                  changes in query, update, and report traffic and
                  natural growth in the types of stored

                  slightly more general network models of the data. In

                  form for data base relations, and the concept of a
                  universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section
                  2, certain operations on relations (other than logical
                  inference) are discussed and applied to the problems
