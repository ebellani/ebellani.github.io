                  gaining insight into and understanding of the
                  principles of database systems. This revision
                  continues to provide a solid grounding in the
                  foundations of database technology and to provide some
                  ideas as to how the field is likely to develop in the
                  future.. "Readers of this book will gain a strong
                  working knowledge of the overall structure, concepts,
                  and objectives of database systems and will become
                  familiar with the theoretical principles underlying
                  the construction of such systems.}
