If you are a knowledge worker seeking to find a friend that believes
truth exists and that parts of it can be reached via our rational
powers, you are my audience.

My name is Eduardo Bellani. My main interests with this page is to write
about computer science, programming, philosophy from a moderate realist
tradition, and leadership.

I have been involved in the world of technology startups for more than
15 years. As developer, manager, entrepreneur, director. Mostly with
functional programming and research oriented projects/companies.
