In my view, Qubes OS lives up to its motto: ~A reasonably secure
operating system~. I use it for work and personal matters every day.

One challenging bit, when you use it in a work setting specially, is to
set up a VPN qube for your [[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#app-qube][app qubes]].

There are probably other ways to do this, but the way I chose to
structure my setup was the following:

#+caption: VPN network structure on Qubes
#+begin_src plantuml :file vpn_qubes.png :exports results :cache yes
  @startuml

  agent "sys-net" as sys_net      #Red
  agent "sys-firewall" as sys_firewall #Green
  agent "personal" as personal     #Yellow
  agent "work-vpn" as work_vpn     #Green
  agent "work" as work         #Blue

  personal     -up-> sys_firewall
  work         -up-> work_vpn
  work_vpn     -up-> sys_firewall
  sys_firewall -up-> sys_net

After you create your [[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#app-qube][app qube]] for the VPN and assuming your template is
Debian, go to the template terminal (Debian 11) and run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ sudo apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
#+end_src

After this you should enable the network-manager service:

[[./vpn-network-service.png]]

Here comes the (for me) obscure trick: after importing your opvn file
through the network manager:

1. Go to IPv4 Settings tab
2. Click to the ~Routes...~ button
3. Select the ~Use this connection only for resources on its network~


Why does it work? I don't know. If you do, please email me.
