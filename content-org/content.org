If you are a knowledge worker seeking to find a friend that believes
truth exists and that parts of it can be reached via our rational
powers, you are my audience.

My name is Eduardo Bellani. My main interests with this page is to write
about computer science, programming, philosophy from a moderate realist
tradition, and leadership.

I have been involved in the world of technology startups for more than
15 years. As developer, manager, entrepreneur, director. Mostly with
functional programming and research oriented projects/companies.

** Recruitment and Selection of high performing programmers

What could be more important for a technology company than great
software? High performing software developers and their teams. After
all, they are the ones who actually create and maintain that great
software.

*** But do they really make a difference?

I'll let the numbers speak for themselves. Here are the typical
variations in:[cite:@diagram_variation_performance]

- Individual performance :: 20 to 1,

- Team performance :: 10 to 1,

- Method performance :: 1.2 to 1.


One can find a compelling illustration of these data on
[cite:@wilson-making-soft]. Two organizations, similar resources,
similar goal, vastly different performance:

- Microsoft excel 3 :: 649000 Lines of Code (Loc) in 50 Man Years (MY) = /12980/
- Lotus 123 :: 400000 LoC in 260 MY = /1538/

*** Recruitment and selection

#+begin_quote
Recruitment is the process of finding potential candidates to apply for
a job position, whereas selection is the process of identifying the best
candidate to hire. [cite:@rec_indeed]
#+end_quote

To find high performing candidates, you need to find markers of
belonging to some high performing culture. Usually something that is
very hard to master and that the marketplace ignores is a good bet. As
an exapmle, for backend developers, one might look for:

- Haskell or other functional programming language not in widespread
  use;

- Relational theory and other rigorous discipline misunderstood by the
  majority of the marketplace,

To filter them, I'd advise using a combination of the following methods
[cite:@schmidt_validity]:

  #+caption: Validity of selection methods
  | Procedure                           | Validity(r) | Multiple(R) | % gain |
  |-------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+--------|
  | GMA tests                           |         .65 |             |        |
  | Integrity tests                     |         .46 |         .78 |    20% |
  | Employment interviews (structured)  |         .58 |         .76 |    18% |
  | Employment interviews               |         .58 |         .73 |    13% |
  | Interests                           |         .31 |         .71 |    10% |
  | Phone-based interviews (structured) |         .46 |         .70 |     9% |
  | Conscientiousness                   |         .22 |         .70 |     8% |
  | Reference checks                    |         .26 |         .70 |     8% |
  | Openness to Experience              |         .04 |         .69 |     6% |
  | Biographical data                   |         .35 |         .68 |     6% |
  | Job experience (years)              |         .16 |         .68 |     5% |

For instance, a (GMA + Integrity + Conscientiousness + Structured
interview + Work Sample) combo should take at most 3 hours from the
candidate and 1 from your team.

** What is a good manager?   :management:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: what-is-a-good-manager
:EXPORT_DATE: 2023-07-29
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :slug what-is-a-good-manager
:END:


It is hard to do science without proper definitions. So what is a manager?

Abstracting from [cite:@horstman2016effective], my definition of a
manager is the following:

#+begin_quote
A manager continuously balances present output with creating the
conditions of future output.
#+end_quote


#+caption: The Good Sheperd, emblem found in a Roman catacomb, sec III
[[./good-shepherd.png]]

As one can see, this definition is similar to an investor. That is
expected, since a manager is an investor of a company's
resources. [fn:1]

As an illustration, a manager can usually deliver more results in the
present by burning up people. This probably will increase turnover in
the future. Is it the right choice? Only with a holistic view and sound
judgement can one decide correctly.

Given this definition, one can easily see that a good manager is *not*
some things:

- An extrovert
- A good communicator
- A frequent yeller
- Someone who cares
- Someone who is agreeable

** Is chatGPT replacing you? or: The nature of the intellectual act :philosophy:

:EXPORT_DATE: 2023-07-11
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :slug ai-intellectual-act
:END:

I have come across people claiming to fear being replaced by bots,
specially chatGPT and other ~large language models (LLM)~. In this
article I'll take such statements at face value, despite my reservations
about the sincerity of many of them.

The short answer is to the question in the title is no, you will not get
replaced. The longer answer is below.

#+attr_shortcode: :side left
#+caption: Rudolph, Conrad. The Mystic Ark: Hugh of Saint Victor, Art, and Thought in the Twelfth Century.
[[./mystic-ark-hires-1.jpg]]

In order to understand if a LLM ~can~ replace you, you need to
understand what it is, since /agere sequitur esse/ (action follows
being). Here's what an authoritative source has to say about it:

#+begin_quote
The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple. Start from
a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc. Then train
a neural net to generate text that’s “like this”. And in particular,
make it able to start from a “prompt” and then continue with text that’s
“like what it’s been trained with”.

As we’ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very
simple elements—though billions of them. And the basic operation of the
neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially of passing input
derived from the text it’s generated so far “once through its elements”
(without any loops, etc.) for every new word (or part of a word) that it
generates. [cite:@chat_gpt_wolfram_2023]
#+end_quote

What it ~does~ is basically statistical correlation. So, what the
intellectual act of a person consists of? My summary of
[cite:@don_educ_fil]:

The intellectual act is a spiritual act, in contrast to a material
one. It consists in abstracting the essential form from individual
sensible perception. Grasping the universals out of particulars.

The last point is what I think underlies the actual fear. We live in a
nominalist age, such that[cite:@wulf_universals] it

#+begin_quote
... denies the existence of abstract and universal concepts, and refuses to
admit that the intellect has the power of engendering them.
#+end_quote

Therein lies the confusion that generates the fear. The correct
interpretation of reality is what has been traditionally called Moderate
Realism[cite:@wulf_universals]:

#+begin_quote
Moderate Realism, finally, declares that there are universal concepts
representing faithfully realities that are not universal.

How can there be harmony between the former and the latter? The latter
are particular, but we have the power of representing them to ourselves
abstractly. Now the abstract type, when the intellect considers it
reflectively and contrasts it with the particular subjects in which it
is realized or capable of being realized, is attributable indifferently
to any and all of them. This applicability of the abstract type to the
individuals is its universality.
#+end_quote

Fear not them, and trust in what you are analogous to, which is the
Intellect itself

** An illustrated way to enable openVPN on Qubes OS 4.1.2         :security:

In my view, Qubes OS lives up to its motto: ~A reasonably secure
operating system~. I use it for work and personal matters every day.

One challenging bit, when you use it in a work setting specially, is to
set up a VPN qube for your [[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#app-qube][app qubes]].

There are probably other ways to do this, but the way I chose to
structure my setup was the following:

#+caption: VPN network structure on Qubes
#+begin_src plantuml :file vpn_qubes.png :exports results :cache yes
  @startuml

  agent "sys-net" as sys_net      #Red
  agent "sys-firewall" as sys_firewall #Green
  agent "personal" as personal     #Yellow
  agent "work-vpn" as work_vpn     #Green
  agent "work" as work         #Blue

  personal     -up-> sys_firewall
  work         -up-> work_vpn
  work_vpn     -up-> sys_firewall
  sys_firewall -up-> sys_net

  @enduml
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[92b96011d1891496217bb07761ac26457b642d99]:
[[file:vpn_qubes.png]]

After you create your [[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#app-qube][app qube]] for the VPN and assuming your template is
Debian, go to the template terminal (Debian 11) and run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ sudo apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
#+end_src

After this you should enable the network-manager service:

[[./vpn-network-service.png]]

Here comes the (for me) obscure trick: after importing your opvn file
through the network manager:

1. Go to IPv4 Settings tab
2. Click to the ~Routes...~ button
3. Select the ~Use this connection only for resources on its network~


Why does it work? I don't know. If you do, please email me.
