  <h2>CQRS as nominalism

  </h2><p>A theme that I think is important to understand a lot of modernity and
the IT sector in particular, is nominalism.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So, what is Nominalism, and why does it matter? I&rsquo;ll start with a
concrete case and work my way to the abstract definition. The case in
point is a somewhat popular architecture tactic, CQRS.</p>
<p>What is CQRS? Here is an authoritative word on it(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Young 2010</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) originated with
Bertrand Meyer’s Command and Query Separation Principle</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>It states that every method should either be a command that performs an
action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In
other words, asking a question should not change the answer. More
formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially
transparent and hence possess no side effects.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Basically it boils down to. If you have a return value you cannot mutate
state. If you mutate state your return type must be void.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>in CQRS objects are split into two objects, one containing the Commands
one containing the Queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CQRS is basically then an extension on CQS, but played on objects
instead of methods. It leverages the notions of immutable and mutable
objects, a feature it shares with a more encompassing approach,
DDD(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Evans 2014</a>). Here is a mapping of the
terminology. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As this table shows, we have new names for old things, and people think
that because of that they <strong>are</strong> different things. My point is that this
is because of a nominalist position of the people on the CQRS community,
even if they are unaware of that. Why? Here&rsquo;s what nominalism is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nominalism &hellip; denies the existence of abstract and universal concepts,
and refuses to admit that the intellect has the power of engendering
them. What are called general ideas are only names, mere verbal
designations, serving as labels for a collection of things or a series
of particular events. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">De Wulf 1911</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t believe that general ideas exist as such, you have a
strong (inevitable?) tendency to mistake names for things, like the
CQRS community did here.</p>
<p><em>PS</em>: Any implementation patterns that apply to CQRS would also apply to
the tradional concepts, since my point here is to show that <strong>they are
the same thing</strong>.</p>
