14 Themes of the Elite Private School Curriculum<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A theory of human nature (as embodied in history, philosophy, theology,
literature and law).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skill in the active literacies (writing, public speaking).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insight into the major institutional forms (courts, corporations, military,
education).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeated exercises in the forms of good manners and politeness; based on
the notion that they are the foundation of all future relationships, all
future alliances, and access to places that you might want to go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energetic physical sports are the only way to confer grace on the human
presence, and that that grace translates into power and money later on. Also,
they teach you practice in handling pain, and in dealing with emergencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A complete theory of access to any place and any person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsibility as an utterly essential part of the curriculum; always to
grab it when it is offered and always to deliver more than is asked for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrival at a personal code of standards (in production, behavior and
morality).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To have a familiarity with, and to be at ease with, the fine
arts. (cultural capital)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of accurate observation and recording. For example, sharpen the
perception by being able to draw accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to deal with challenges of all sorts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A habit of caution in reasoning to conclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The constant development and testing of prior judgements: you make
judgements, you discriminate value, and then you follow up and “keep an eye”
on your predictions to see how far skewed, or how consistent, your
predictions were.</p>
</li>
