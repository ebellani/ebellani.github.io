  </h2><p>It is hard to do science without proper definitions. So what is a manager?</p>
<p>Abstracting from (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Horstman 2016</a>), my definition of a
manager is the following:</p>
<p><code>A manager balances present output with creating the conditions of future output.</code></p>

<p>As one can see, this definition is the same as the one for an
investor. That is correct. A manager is an investor of company&rsquo;s
resources (human or otherwise). He deploys them with the expectation of
generating results in the present. If he is good, he deploys them in
such a way as to create conditions to generate <strong>more</strong> results in the
future.</p>
<p>As an illustration, a manager can usually deliver more results in the
present by burning up people. It probably will increase turnover in the
future. Is it the right choice? Only with a holistic view and sound
judgement can one decide correctly.</p>
<p>Given this definition, one can easily see that a good manager is <strong>not</strong>
some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extrovert</li>
<li>A good communicator</li>
<li>A frequent yeller</li>
<li>Someone who cares</li>
<li>Someone who is agreeable</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: A complicating factor for the manager is that he is trying to
balance a system over time, but the balancing point itself changes.</p>
