  <h2>Recruitment and Selection of high performing programmers

  </h2><p>What could be more important for a technology company than great
software? High performing software developers and their teams. After
all, they are the ones who actually create and maintain that great
software.</p>
<h2 id="but-do-they-really-make-a-difference">But do they really make a difference?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let the numbers speak for themselves. Here are the typical
variations in:(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Steve 2014</a>)</p>
<dl>
<dt>Individual performance</dt>
<dd>20 to 1,</dd>
<dt>Team performance</dt>
<dd>10 to 1,</dd>
<dt>Method performance</dt>
<dd>1.2 to 1.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One can find a compelling illustration of these data on
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Oram and Wilson 2010</a>). Two organizations, similar resources,
similar goal, vastly different performance:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Microsoft excel 3</dt>
<dd>649000 Lines of Code (Loc) in 50 Man Years (MY) = <em>12980</em></dd>
<dt>Lotus 123</dt>
<dd>400000 LoC in 260 MY = <em>1538</em></dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="recruitment-and-selection">Recruitment and selection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Recruitment is the process of finding potential candidates to apply for
a job position, whereas selection is the process of identifying the best
candidate to hire. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Team 2023</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find high performing candidates, you need to find markers of
belonging to some high performing culture. Usually something that is
very hard to master and that the marketplace ignores is a good bet. As
an exapmle, for backend developers, one might look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Haskell or other functional programming language not in widespread
use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relational theory and other rigorous discipline misunderstood by the
majority of the marketplace,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To filter them, I&rsquo;d advise using a combination of the following methods
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Schmidt 2016</a>):</p>
<div class="table-caption">

</table>
<p>For instance, a (GMA + Integrity + Conscientiousness + Structured
interview + Work Sample) combo should take at most 3 hours from the
candidate and 1 from your team.</p>
