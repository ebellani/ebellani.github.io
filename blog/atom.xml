    <summary>I have come across people claiming to fear being replaced by bots, specially the given the novelty of chatGPT and other large language models (LLM). In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll take such statements at face value, despite my reservations about the sincerity of many of them.
The short answer is to the question in the title is no, you will not get replaced. The longer answer is below.

despite my reservations about the sincerity of many of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand if a LLM &lt;code&gt;can&lt;/code&gt; replace you, you need to
understand what it is, since &lt;em&gt;agere sequitur esse&lt;/em&gt; (action follows
being). Here&amp;rsquo;s what an authoritative source has to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept of ChatGPT is at some level rather simple. Start from
a huge sample of human-created text from the web, books, etc. Then train
a neural net to generate text that’s “like this”. And in particular,
make it able to start from a “prompt” and then continue with text that’s
“like what it’s been trained with”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, the actual neural net in ChatGPT is made up of very
simple elements—though billions of them. And the basic operation of the
neural net is also very simple, consisting essentially of passing input
derived from the text it’s generated so far “once through its elements”
(without any loops, etc.) for every new word (or part of a word) that it
generates. (Wolfram, Stephen, 2023)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it &lt;code&gt;does&lt;/code&gt; is basically statistical correlation. So, what the
intellectual act of a person consists of? My summary of
(Antônio Donato Paulo Rosa, 1993):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intellectual act is a spiritual act, in contrast to a material
one. It consists in abstracting the essential form from individual
sensible perception. Grasping the universals out of particulars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point is what I think underlies the actual fear. We live in a
nominalist age, such that(De Wulf, Maurice, 1911) it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; denies the existence of abstract and universal concepts, and refuses to
admit that the intellect has the power of engendering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein lies the confusion that generates the fear. The correct
interpretation of reality is what has been traditionally called Moderate
Realism(De Wulf, Maurice, 1911):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate Realism, finally, declares that there are universal concepts
representing faithfully realities that are not universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can there be harmony between the former and the latter? The latter
are particular, but we have the power of representing them to ourselves
abstractly. Now the abstract type, when the intellect considers it
reflectively and contrasts it with the particular subjects in which it
is realized or capable of being realized, is attributable indifferently
to any and all of them. This applicability of the abstract type to the
individuals is its universality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not them, and trust in what you are analogous to, which is the
Intellect itself&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An illustrated way to enable openVPN on Qubes OS 4.1.2</title>

    <summary>In my view, Qubes OS lives up to its motto: A reasonably secure operating system. I use it for work and personal matters every day.
One challenging bit, when you use it in a work setting specially, is to set up a VPN qube for your app qubes.
There are probably other ways to do this, but the way I chose to structure my setup was the following:

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/ox-hugo/vpn_qubes.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you create your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/glossary/#app-qube&#34;&gt;app qube&lt;/a&gt; for the VPN and assuming your template is
Debian, go to the template terminal (Debian 11) and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  $ sudo apt install openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this you should enable the network-manager service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/ox-hugo/vpn-network-service.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here comes the (for me) obscure trick: after importing your opvn file
through the network manager:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to IPv4 Settings tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click to the &lt;code&gt;Routes...&lt;/code&gt; button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the &lt;code&gt;Use this connection only for resources on its network&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does it work? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. If you do, please email me.&lt;/p&gt;
