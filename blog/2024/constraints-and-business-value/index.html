  <h2>Integrity Constraints and business value

  </h2><p>Again with this database business? Let me try to motivate you dear
reader before I start again with a illustrative case: SQL Injections!</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL injection is one of the oldest vulnerabilities still present in
the OWASP TOP 10 (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">CyberSecura 2021</a>)</li>
<li>A well documented case puts the cost of one SQL Injection in USD 196k
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Group 2014</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, and how these are related to databases, and more specifically
constraints? And what are these constraints?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong> are informal business rules (BR) expressed in natural
language that constrain the values of the shared properties of entity
members of a class.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity constraints</strong> are the formalized versions of the constraints
as first order predicates that represent them in the database, expressed
in a specific data language and enforced by the DBMS in the database for
all applications, with potential reduction in application development
and maintenance estimated at as high as 80%.</p>
<p>Integrity independence (II)—DBMS-enforced integrity in the database—was
a major objective and is an advantage of database management in general
and relational database management in particular (and is enshrined as
one of the famous 12 Codd rules). It is much superior to
application-enforced integrity— <strong>a redundant, unreliable and prone to
error development and maintenance burden— which was readily subvertible</strong>. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Pascal 2016</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, say I got your attention about SQL Injections and you have some
clarity on what I mean by constraints. How do I connect these 2 topics?</p>
<p>Here is how: if developers were aware that you could encode your
authentication/authorization rules at the DBMS level as integrity
constraints, SQL injections would be impossible!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; why do it?</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All access control performed by database – even if application code is compromised</li>
<li>Essentially, users can be given freeform sql access – database is a
Fort Knox and will not allow unauthorized operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developer productivity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No more time spent on access control and worrying about security</li>
<li>Even the new guy can now safely work on applications, api’s etc.</li>
<li>Worst case, api breaks, but the data is perfectly safe (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Swart 2019</a>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the double effect of properly encoding this integrity
constraint (data access) where it belongs (with the system managing the data):</p>
<ol>
<li>You avoid an entire class of common and expensive problems</li>
<li>Because of that, your developers can work on your actual product
instead of solving this non issue over and over again.</li>
</ol>
