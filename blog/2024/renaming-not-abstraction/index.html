<p>abstraction (n.) (Latin abs, from trahere, to draw).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people I consider good software engineers complaining that
over-abstraction is a (the?) major problem in our industry today. Such
points are usually raised when discussing software architecture in
particular (one example: (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">iamprovidence 2023</a>)).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to defend abstraction, and how I don&rsquo;t think it is possible to
have over abstraction (in the same sense you cannot be overly good, or
overly healthy).</p>
<p>The definition I&rsquo;d like to use for abstraction is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most eminent Scholastics, however, following Aristotle, ascribe to
the mind in its higher aspect a power (called the Active Intellect)
which abstracts from the representations of concrete things or qualities
the typical, ideal, essential elements, leaving behind those that are
material and particular.  (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Duffy 1907</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one can see from such definition, the process is to select the
essentials from its concrete manifestation. On software engineering,
that means picking out the right form for your requirements, functional
or otherwise.</p>
<p>What I think people are complaining about is renaming/rebranding
concepts, which is rife in our industry (see the table on <a href="/blog/2023/cqrs-nominalism/">CQRS as
nominalism</a> for an example).</p>
<p>What to do then, as a software engineer? Go beyond names, and meditate
on the essences of your craft. What is a function, what is a relation,
what is a number? It will then not matter (to you at least) if someone
calls a function an object, or a relation a table.</p>
