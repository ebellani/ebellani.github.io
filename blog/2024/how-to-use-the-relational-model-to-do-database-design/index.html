<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; what you mean that you use the relation model to design? &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first start with the motivation: <strong>Why</strong> should one use the
relational model(RM) to do database design? Here is my one line answer:</p>
<p><em>It makes it possible to have and to maintain the integrity of your
business rules.</em></p>
<p>To illustrate this point, here are some examples of problems that one
faces when one does not have such integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li>A status got written to &lsquo;Done&rsquo;, but the data that was expected to be
there was not (eventual consistency)</li>
<li>Some data that your application depends on got deleted (delete anomaly)</li>
<li>A join returns more information than expected (update anomaly)</li>
<li>Slow queries (optimizer problems due to duplicates)
<ul>
<li>Ambiguous duplicates in results (duplicates)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrong query results (NULLs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to the point at hand: How would one use the relational model to
design a database? Let me start by a definition of what is the
relational model:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An open-ended collection of scalar types, including type BOOLEAN in
particular</li>
<li>A type generator and an intended interpretation for relations of
types generated thereby</li>
<li>Facilities for defining variables of such generated
relation types</li>
<li>A assignment operator for assigning values to such variables</li>
<li>A complete (but otherwise open-ended) collection of generic operators
for deriving values from other values</li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Date 2015</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define a database:</p>
<p><em>A database is a set of predicates and instatiations of such as
propositions.</em> The RM uses relation types to represent predicates. SQL
uses table definitions. The RM uses relations to represent the arguments
of a predicate, SQL uses rows.</p>
<p>In short, the RM set global constraints on any database design. Here is
a (probably incomplete) list with ways that the RM drives database
design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never allow NULL anywhere (avoid <code>NULL</code> generating operators, such as <code>OUTER JOIN</code>)</li>
<li>Never allow duplicates (avoid duplicates generating queries, such as <code>&lt;SELECT | UNION&gt; All</code>)</li>
<li>Never depend on position of columns or rows</li>
<li>Always make sure each table represents one and only one predicate, thus being in 5NF</li>
<li>Use updateable views to have logical independence (simulate them with triggers)</li>
</ul>
