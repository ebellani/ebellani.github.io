  <h2>How to unlock motivation for high performance in your team

  </h2><p>As an engineering manager(EM), one of your core tasks is to build and
maintain a team of high performance. To accomplish this, it should be
obvious that motivation is a key factor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do followers join some teams but not others? How do you get
followers to exhibit enough of the critical behaviors needed for the
team to succeed? And why are some leaders capable of getting followers
to go above and beyond the call of duty? The ability to motivate others
is a fundamental leadership skill and has strong connections to building
cohesive, goal-oriented teams and getting results through others. The
importance of follower motivation is suggested in findings that most
people believe they could give as much as 15 percent or 20 percent more
effort at work than they now do with no one, including their own bosses,
recognizing any difference. Perhaps even more startling, these workers
also believed they could give 15 percent or 20 percent less effort with
no one noticing any difference. Moreover, variation in work output
varies significantly across leaders and followers. The top 15 percent of
workers in any particular job may produce 20 to 50 percent more output
than the average worker, depending on the complexity of the job. Put
another way, the best computer programmers or salesclerks might write up
to 50 percent more programs or process 50 percent more customer orders.

</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that you are convinced that having a motivated team is key
for your success as an EM. Now comes the question, how? Everyone and
their dog has advice on this, mostly about your interactions with your
followers. This article will focus on a different angle: the advice is
to you about you, or more specifically, about your vision.</p>
<p>Why vision?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Followers expect leaders to provide a sense of mission and a hopeful
view of the future and to explain why they are doing what they are doing
and why it matters. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Warrenfeltz and Kellett 2016</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, how do you develop a vision? Since action follows from essence, we
should understand what is the essence of a man. For this context, what
matters is that man is a creature in tension between his contingent
situation and the contemplation of God, the Eternal transcendence.</p>
<p>The way man deals with this tension sucessfully is with a story. This
story is what connects his present to the vanishing point we call the
future. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Noica, Blyth, and Stoiciu 2009</a>)</p>
<p>Since it is likely that the vast majority of people you will encounter
as followers have no such story, they will be inclined to follow yours
as long as you present it clearly and be able to connect it to the
company&rsquo;s goals.</p>
<p>Summing it up: clarify to yourself and to others what is your story and
how it connects to the current situation. There are specific tools
available if you want help crafting your story, such as
