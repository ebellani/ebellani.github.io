  </h2><p>I recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7147881347099926528?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7147881347099926528%2C7148003385328271360%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287148003385328271360%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7147881347099926528%29">commented</a> on how the book (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Kleppmann 2017</a>)
is a dangerous book, due to a subtle error on how it defines data
models. I suppose it&rsquo;s my burden to further clarify this point, and for
that I&rsquo;ll use Hayek&rsquo;s critical methodological maxim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must first explain how an economy can possibly work right before we
can meaningfully ask what might go wrong</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-a-data-model">What is a data model?</h2>
<p>Here are 3 definitions, in increasing level of detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data model is an abstract, self-contained, logical definition of the
objects, operators, and so forth, that together constitute the abstract
machine with which users interact. The objects allow us to model the
structure of data. The operators allow us to model its behavior.
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Date 2003</a>):</p>
</blockquote>
<!--quoteend-->
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>a collection of data structure types (the building blocks of any
database that conforms to the model);</li>
<li>a collection of operators or inferencing rules, which can be applied
to any valid instances of the data types listed in (i), to retrieve
or derive data from any parts of those structures in any combinations
desired;</li>
<li>a collection of general integrity rules, which implicitly or
explicitly define the set of consistent database states or changes of
state or both &ndash; these rules may sometimes be expressed as
insert-update-delete rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Codd 1980</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, the Relational Data Model</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>An open-ended collection of scalar types, including type BOOLEAN in
particular</li>
<li>A type generator and an intended interpretation for relations of
types generated thereby</li>
<li>Facilities for defining variables of such generated
relation types</li>
<li>A assignment operator for assigning values to such variables</li>
<li>A complete (but otherwise open-ended) collection of generic operators
for deriving values from other values</li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Date 2015</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, in our industry, it almost exclusively means a model of
which information is relevant to particular business cases. Those used
to be called Conceptual Schemas. It is part of the classic data model
progression(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_6">Steel 1975</a>):</p>
<p>Conceptual schema -&gt; Logical schema -&gt; Physical schema <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>What are those? I can&rsquo;t do better than (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Pascal 2016</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of a conceptual model as the territory, the logical model as its
symbolic representation on the map and the map print and medium (paper,
plastic, screen) as the physical model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about the Data Model, how does it fit in this metaphor?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data model is the map legend that provides the mapping symbols and
their correspondence to the elements of the territory (e.g., cities,
highways, forests and so on) they symbolize on the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-wrong-with-the-book-s-definition">What is wrong with the book&rsquo;s definition?</h2>
<p>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Kleppmann 2017</a>) does not provide an explicit
definition. The closest he has is this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of
another. For each layer, the key question is: how is it represented in
terms of the next-lower layer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My translation of this, given the rest of the book&rsquo;s chapter on Data
Models, is that a Data Model for the author is any particular
implementation of a higher abstraction in a lower abstraction would
count as a Data Model. So, the author refers to all 4 models (and any
concrete instance of them) using the same term.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>I hope that the consequences of such confusion would be clear to the
reader. If not, consider the advice of (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Pascal 2016</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Referring to all four as data models, or using the terms interchangeably
blurs the important differences, reflecting common confusion of levels
of representation, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual-logical conflation (CLC);</li>
<li>Logical-physical confusion (LPC).</li>
</ul>
<p>with costly consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single example from the book should suffice, I think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily
achieve, including very large datasets or very high write throughput
&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the author is confusing a Data Model (the relational data model)
with physical concerns (scalability and throughput), which might lead to
wrong (and very costly) technology and business decisions.</p>
