  </h2><p>If the way you think others see you is in stark contrast to how others
actually see you, you are in danger of derailing in your career.</p>
<p>To avoid that, here are 3 steps, and a reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask and <strong>embrace</strong> feedback from bosses, peers and followers<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,</li>
<li>Expose your most cherished ideas to the most intense forms of public scrutiny you can find,</li>
<li>See ways to measure yourself, such as 360 feedback mechanisms and
validated personality assessments.</li>
</ol>
<p>It all boils down to reducing your own cognitive
dissonance(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Festinger 1957</a>), which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; The maximum dissonance which could exist &hellip;  determined by the
resistance to admitting that he had been wrong or foolish.</p>
</blockquote>
