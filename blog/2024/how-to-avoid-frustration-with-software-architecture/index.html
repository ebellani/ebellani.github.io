  </h2><p>It is becoming more common for companies to come out with stories on the
downsides of distributed microservice
architectures<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Kolny 2023</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Ghemawat et al. 2023</a>).</p>
<p>Instead of hopping in this bandwagon, as tempting as this might be, I
want to suggest how could one avoid being caught in such situation in
the first place.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I think the problem that originated the current
dissatisfaction with microservices is a double confusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>between the form (modules) and the matter (interacting running
processes) of software and(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Ainsworth 2024</a>);</li>
<li>between the the form (modules) of software and the form of software
building organizations (teams, executing environments,
deployment pipelines &hellip;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly enough, such structures are the 3 categories of software
architecture proposed in a standard Software Architecture
book:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Module structures</dt>
<dd>partition systems into implementation units</dd>
<dt>Component-and-connector (C&amp;C) structures</dt>
<dd>focus on the way the
elements interact with each other at runtime to carry out the system’s
functions.</dd>
<dt>Allocation structures</dt>
<dd>establish the mapping from software
structures to the system’s non-software structures, such as its
organization, or its development, test, and execution
environments. (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Bass et al. 2021</a>)</dd>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>In order to avoid confusion and unecessary costs, the next time you are
discussing software architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you know which category you are talking about;</li>
<li>Insist on exaustive definitions of key terms (such as <code>module</code>);</li>
<li>Be sure to refer to reputable sources.</li>
</ol>
