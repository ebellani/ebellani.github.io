    </small>
  </h2><p>Recently there has been an interest in cheating(?) leetcode style
interviews(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_6">Yang 2025</a>). These articles highlight
a longstanding issue in tech recruiting: puzzle-style assessments have
little to no correlation with actual job
performance(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Konnikova 2013</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">McAllister 2013</a>), and leetcode is nothing but algorithmic
puzzles. This makes them a poor predictor of job performance. What
leetcode does predict seems to be success at leetcode style
interviews(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Mroczka 2024</a>). Go figure.</p>
<p>If you are in power to stop doing these silly things and reach for
something with actual evidence of working, here is a blueprint for
performing a structured interview with a focus on programmers, but that
can be adapted for other positions quite easily.</p>
<p>A core part of a structured interview is to determine the competencies
to be assessed by the
interview(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">of Personnel Management 2008</a>). According to
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Hogan and Warrenfeltz 2003</a>), the skills and behaviors found in virtually
every organizational competency model fall into one of four major
domains, and that they form a natural, overlapping developmental
sequence, with the latter skills (e.g., Leadership Skills) depending on
the appropriate development of the earlier skills (e.g., Intrapersonal
Skills).</p>
<h2 id="intrapersonal">Intrapersonal</h2>
<p>These skills develop early in childhood and have important consequences for
career development in adulthood. Core components include core-self esteem,
resiliency, and self-control. Intrapersonal skills form the foundation on which
careers develop.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity of planning made a
difference?</li>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity for discipline made
a difference?</li>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity for flexibility
in thinking made a difference?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="answers">Answers</h4>
<dl>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated very little conscientiousness and emotional
stability in the answers. Apathetic, unstable, resented.</dd>
<dt>5</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated a lot of conscientiousness. Resiliency,
intelligent risk taking, disciplined effort.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h2>
<p>These skills concern building and sustaining relationships. Interpersonal skills
can be described in terms of three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>an ability to put oneself in the position of another person,</li>
<li>an ability to accurately perceive and anticipate other’s expectations, and</li>
<li>an ability to incorporate information about the other person&rsquo;s expectations
into subsequent behavior.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity for building
relationships with others made a difference?</li>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity for teamwork
made a difference?</li>
<li>Can you describe a situation in your life where your capacity for
communicating made a difference?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="answers">Answers</h4>
<dl>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated very little capacity for working with
others. Imprecise language, bad intonation, weird social cues.</dd>
<dt>5</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated a lot of capacity to integrate and to work with
others. Lots of agreeable, extroverted behaviors.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>
<p>These skills differ from Intrapersonal and Interpersonal skills in that they are</p>
<ol>
<li>the last to develop,</li>
<li>the easiest to teach,</li>
<li>the most cognitive, and</li>
<li>the least dependent upon dealing with other people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technical skills involve comparing, compiling, innovating, computing, analyzing,
coordinating, synthesizing, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe your technical progress in your career?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favorite programming language and why do you like it the most?</li>
<li>Can you describe how you make technical judgements when facing scarce
resources (time, etc)?</li>
<li>Can you describe what is a good software development environment?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="answers">Answers</h4>
<dl>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated very little awareness of the Computer Science
field. Only the obvious knowledge, and very shallow at that.</dd>
<dt>5</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated amazing grasp of the field, quoting different
areas and integrating them into a coherent whole.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="business">Business</h2>
<p>These skills can be understood in terms of components that depend upon
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and technical skills. The point here is to
understand if the person is capable of using his whole tool set to generate
value for others.</p>
<p>For a leader these entail an ability to recruit talented people to join the
team. Second, one must be able to retain talent once it has been
recruited. Third, one must be able to motivate a team. Fourth, effective leaders
are able to develop and promote a vision for the team. Finally, leadership skill
involves being persistent and hard to discourage.</p>
<p>For a follower, the persistance component is shared, alongside initiative.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe a situation where you generated value for others?</li>
<li>Can you describe a situation where your initiative made a difference?</li>
<li>Can you describe how your technical knowledge might help a business like ours?</li>
<li>Can you describe what is a good software development team?</li>
<li>Can you describe what is your ideal technical vision?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="answers">Answers</h4>
<dl>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated very little capacity for integrating his
knowledge. Confused technical vision, murky connections.</dd>
<dt>5</dt>
<dd>Candidate demonstrated a great grasp on how to use his whole knowledge to
help the business and his team.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Tech hiring is long overdue for an evidence-based overhaul. Structured
interviews rooted in validated competencies not only predict performance
better — they respect candidates&rsquo; time and intelligence. If you’re
hiring engineers, skip the puzzles and build a process that actually
works.</p>
