      <description>It is hard to do science without proper definitions. So what is a manager?
Abstracting from (Horstman 2016), my definition of a manager is the following:
 A manager continuously balances present output with creating the conditions of future output.
  Figure 1: The Good Sheperd, emblem found in a Roman catacomb, sec III
  As one can see, this definition is similar to an investor. That is expected, since a manager is an investor of a company&amp;rsquo;s resources.</description>
